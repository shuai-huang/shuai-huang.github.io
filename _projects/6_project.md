## Approximate Message Passing with Built-in Parameter Estimation

Under the Bayesian framework, the signal x follows a sparsity-promoting distribution. The distribution parameters are treated as unknown variables and jointly recovered with the signal via Approximate Message Passing {% cite AMP_PE_1bit %}.
