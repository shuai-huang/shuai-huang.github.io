    content: I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Auburn University, with affliation to the Neuroimaging Center. Prior to joining Auburn ECE in Fall 2024, I obtained my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Johns Hopkins University, where I have been very fortunate to have Dr. Trac D. Tran as my advisor. I was a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Ivan Dokmanic's group at the Univeresity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and in Dr. Deqiang Qiu's group at Emory University.
    My research leverages machine learning and signal processing approaches to address challenges in neuroimaging and neuroscience. I am fascinated by the ultimate quest to find order in data!
