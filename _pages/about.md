Welcome to the `Computational Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence (CNAI)` Lab!

- We develop machine learning and artifical intelligence methods to address exciting challenges in Neuroscience. 
- By analyzing neuroimaging data acquired with tools like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), we aim to uncover mysteries of the brain and understand the cognitive mechanism. 
- We explore solutions for the diagonisis of neurodegeneration and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Research interests: machine learning, AI for healthcare, MRI, computational imaging, numerical optimization

**CNAI lab is actively looking for highly motivated students. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me: shuai.huang@auburn.edu**

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
