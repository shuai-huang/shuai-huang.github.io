Welcome to the `Computational Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence (CNAI)` Lab!

We develop machine learning and artifical intelligence methods to address exciting challenges in Neuroscience. By analyzing neuroimaging data acquired with tools like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), we aim to uncover mysteries of the brain and understand the cognitive mechanism. We offer solutions for the diagonisis of neurodegeneration and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Research interests: machine learning, AI for healthcare, MRI, computational imaging, numerical optimization

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
